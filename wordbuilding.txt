QUICK INTRO: 
	word building is based on verbal roots 

	sample: -take a common verb and think of an easy sentence 
		(adjectives count as verbs) 
		
		- associate it with one or two common English words - preferable 
		  not on this list 

		fallen from above --> hail, meteroide,[[bird shit]]

		wandering above --> cloud 

		keeping for later --> brain, storage 

		made someone appear --> mother,father
