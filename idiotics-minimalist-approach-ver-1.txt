A minimalistic approach using idiotic endings for Word derivation version 1 
===========================================================================

Many conlangers stumble over grammar and word derivation. This text should help
you out with it. 

I propose a very simple approach with just 256 or 16x16 root words. For ease the 
root words can also be used as pronouns. 

Out of those 256 root words 64 idiotic endings are formed which are used for 
word derivation only. It is calculated that this 64 idotic endings or idiotics 
would be enough to form enough derivations so that the language can be useful. 

This is based on the fact that the most used 5000 words make far more than 95% 
of every day speech. 

So this would be theoretically 2^14 or around 16 000 possible derivations where 
only 5000 or even less are used. There would be no confusion whether a word is 
a derivation or a phrase which is the case in other common conlangs. 

The verb of every phrase should help to narrow the meaning of the used nouns 
and pronouns so that there would be no problems assigning multiple meanings to 
one word derivation. 

I recommend always starting every statement with a verb because I think it would 
ease up things. 

I discourage the use of real adjectives but I recommend use of verb like or predicative
adjectives like "is green" and so on. 

The use of pronouns should replace the use of articles and R-expressions. 


A minimalistic phonem/phonology approach
========================================

This approach or proposal is yet without the use of phonological rules. 

I propose the use of 8 consonants and three vowels. 
A stressed or accented vowel is made up of two basic vowels. 

Thus I propose the scheme : CVVC ( C= consonant , V= vowel) for accented syllabels 

For root words I propose thus CVVC(V) and for the idiotic endings CVC. 

CVC would give 8*8*3 or 192 possible idiotic endings , but only 64 would be used 
thus only around a third. 

As can be calculated there are enough free unused combinations left. 

For convenience I am going to use the following characters for the eight consonants: 

		p t k s m n l j 

and a , i , u for the vowels ...


A minimalistic grammar approach
===============================

The simplest grammar would be Verb plus Argument. 
I recommend usage of default parameters ... Thus "I" , "you" and so on 
are set by default and can be changed with statements or phrases. 

So a simple statement can consist of : 

                    Verb derived-word (= root word + derived ending) 
                    
                    Verb pronoun ( every pronoun is a root word) 

Commands and questions can be declared with phrases. 

		    *: Ask question.  (indicates that the next phrase is a command) 

                    *: Command this. (indicates that the next phrase is a command) 

Samples of default parameters : 

		    *: Give food. ( 'to you' and "I" are the default parameters) 

Everything else like time and place and so on must be made understood with separate phrases. 

Time can easily be expressed with a statement like : happened yesterday. 


So what to do with Negation
===========================

You may ask so how is negation done using only the above mentionend word order. 

Sometimes negation can be done on the object. 

		Don't speak ! ==> Say nothing!. 
		
		Don't move ! ==> Go nowhere! 

However this isn't sometimes very satisfying. For instance you want to say to a child
"don't touch the dog!" or "don't touch the stove!"  because "touch nothing!" would not 
cover the intended meaning. 

So the best choice would be to make a new verb with the meaning "don't touch" and the problem
be solved. It is proven that negated verbs and sentences are more difficult to understand than
positive formulated sentences. 

There is also another way round which is basically just saying "the following statement is not true"
or "the following statements are not true". 

		You don't speak. ==> Following not true. You speak. 


On reduced pronouns and sentence structure
==========================================


I am still not quite satisfied with having 256 possible pronouns , so I propose to reduce 
it to around 32, which would still be sufficient and more than many natural languages use anyway. 

The other reason I was not satisfied with the 256 pronouns was , that those pronouns would use 
stress vowels and I think it would be better when there are more phrases with only on stressed vowel. 

I suggest to use 32 of the 64 idiotics as pronouns too. 


So a sentence would consists of : 

				CVVC(V) CVC CVC

or 
				CVVC(V) CVC CVVC(V) CVC

or in other words : <root-word> <idiotic> <pronoun>   or <root-word> <idiotic> <root-word> <idiotic>

Because phrases have that simple structure it would be practical to write all words together in them
without spaces. The structure can easily be understood because of language structure. 

A verb must end with an idiotic to avoid confusion. 


An Abbrevation Ending
=====================

Sometimes it would come handy to use an abbrevation. Such a case would be when one wants to say 
"Yes" or "No!". So instead of saying >>paulitatnis<< (=the following is not true. ) one may want 
to say just simply "pau" or "po".

To avoid confusion one can use the abbrevation ending "sis" which can be phonolgically shortened 
to just "shh". So instead of saying "paulitat..." one would just say "poshh" or "paushh" 
and this was it. 


On foreign words and names
==========================

There should be a way to introduce foreign names and toponyms and so on which would hurt 
the language structure. 

I suggest a verb with the meaning "it is pronounced like" or "this is pronounced" like 
would be sufficient. 

I apply this to the previous mentioned. 

			kauji-kun mas. sauke-tat "Moscow". 

translation:            go-to mas(=pronoun). pronounced "Moscow". 

this could be written applying mentioned rules as : 

			kaujikunmas sauketat Moscow 

Capitalization being only used for words hurting the language structure. 


Translations of the samples
===========================

Verb 
kauji-kun going/travelling to a city (paramater or pronoun refers to city or place name) 
kiimi-man  give (to me) ... (parameter or pronoun refers to small hand held object) 
kiisi-jun ask something ... (pronoun refers to first word in question) 
kauma-jun command something ...(pronoun refers to first word in command) 
maupu-lus moving or going to somewhere close (pronoun refers to something nearby) 
pauli-tat the following is not true 
taili-jun tell something, say something (to me) 

Pronouns 
jam ... something eatable,food 
kit ... something,anything,what? 
nik ... nothing 
nis ... the following


		Give me food ! -> kiimimanjam 
		Don't ask me anything ! -> kiisijunnik 
		Don't move ! -> maupulusnik
		Shut up! (don't speak!) -> tailijunnik
                You don't speak. -> paulitatnis tailijunkit 




On phonological rules 
=====================

Let's say we want more sounds so we define that "au" is pronounced like 
a stressed "o" like in open, "ki" should be pronounced "ch" like in "chew" 
, "ai" to pronounced "e" like in "get" , "si" to be pronounced "sh" and  
"pu" to be pronounced just "f". 
Further we want phrase final "k" to be pronounced like the German sound
in bach or the Russian word "ikh" and write it with the IPA symbol x. 
Also we want the sequence "iju" to be pronounced "ju" like in "you" but
with a short "u". 


So the following phrases would be read: 

			kiimimanjam -> ĉímimanjam 
			kiisijunnik -> ĉíŝjunnix
			maupulusnik -> móflusnix 
			tailijunnik -> téljunnix 

Further phonological rules can be applied like distance assimilation 
and reduction. 

When the same vowel appears in the last two unstressed syllabels 
one has to be omitted. Thus -manjam would be reduced to -mnjam. 

			ĉímimanjam -> ĉímimnjam 

When "u" is followed by "i" in the next unstressed syllabel it is changed
to an umlaut like French "u" in "tu" (IPA symbol y). I prefer Hungarian,
German ,Turkish ü for that sound. 

			ĉíŝjunnix -> ĉíŝjünnix 
			móflusnix -> móflüsnix 
			téljunnix -> téljünnix
