Third version of the idiotics mininmalist approach conlang
==========================================================

I was not quite satisfied with patterns in the second version
for the seemed too narrow and allowed too less possibilities. 

The strategy should really be "allow much more" so that "much less"
can be used. And for this I decided to replace the patterns 
in the version two with the following patterns. 

		1. (prefix) verb+idiotic pronoun (case vowel)  
		2. (circumfix-prefix) verb+idiotic (circumfix-infix) pronoun (case vowel) 

and for the long patterns 

		1. (prefix) verb+idiotic noun  
		2. (circumfix-prefix) verb+idiotic (circumfix-infix) noun 


So as with version two the noun derives from the short patterns which 
were basically >> verb+idiotic pronoun<< and are now extended to 
>>(prefix) verb+idiotic pronoun<< and the circumfixed version. 

The brackets mean that the prefix and in the second pattern the circumfix
can be dropped , so that it is basically the old pattern. 

I thought of using 6 prefixes and for the circumfixes I thought of indicating
them by two circumfix-prefixes and then having another 64 circumfix-infixes 
which would allow quite a lot of word building , word derivation and special 
grammatical or so functions. 

So for the second short pattern that would be 128 ( 2 * 64) infixes , 
256 verbal roots , 64 idiotics and 32 pronouns, allowing 128 * 256 * 64 * 32 
or 2^26 ( ~ 67 million ) possible combinations. So probably less than 0.1 
or even 0.01 % would probably be used.

The case vowel as it is called now was a feature introduced in version 2 
which has the needy effect in reducing the number of required verbal root 
derivations, because it is possible to use the same verbal derivation
(=verb+idiotic) for both passive and active meaning.

I thought the given sample was : 
			tailisannim ... The following was told by the dog like animal. 
			tailisannimu ... The following was told to the dog like animal. 

Because it is basically a vowel added at the end of the statement I just call it a case vowel.

So to sum it up I give the possible long and short patterns once again. 

short patterns 

		 1.. CVVCV CVC CVC (without prefix;introduced in version 1 ) 
                 1a. CVVCV CVC CVC V (like the one above but with case-vowel introduced in version 2) 
		 2.. CV CVVCV CVC CVC (prefixed) 
		 2a. CV CVVCV CVC CVC V (with case vowel)  	 
		 3.. CV CVVCV CVC CVC CVC (circumfixed) 
		 3a. CV CVVCV CVC CVC CVC V 

and the long patterns

		1.. CVVCV CVC CVVCV CVC CVC (V) (without prefix;introduced in version 2) 
		1a. CVVCV CVC CV CVVCV CVC CVC (V) 
		1b. CVVCV CVC CV CVVCV CVC CVC CVC (V) 

		2.. CV CVVCV CVC CVC CVVCV CVC CVC (V) (prefixed) 
		2a. CV CVVCV CVC CVC CV CVVCV CVC CVC (V) 
		2b. CV CVVCV CVC CVC CV CVVCV CVC CVC CVC (V) 

		3.. CV CVVCV CVC CVC CVC CVVCV CVC CVC (V) (circumfixed) 
		3a. CV CVVCV CVC CVC CVC CV CVVCV CVC CVC (V) 
		3b. CV CVVCV CVC CVC CVC CV CVVCV CVC CVC CVC (V) 


Very Short pronounless statements or sentences 
==============================================

Because pronounless phrases like "Halt!" "Stop!" "Sit!" and so on occur in 
nearly all languages I thought of allowing in them in the IMAC or this language
too. 

So I thought of introducing a very short pattern even shorter than the abbreviated
pattern, which should look like 

			verb+suffix 

Suffixes should be only allowed for this pattern and I think four different are more 
than enough. 

So the structure would look like 

			CVVCV CV 

and would allow 256*4 or 1024 possibilities of whom also a modest fraction would become common - 
probably for commanding dogs.
