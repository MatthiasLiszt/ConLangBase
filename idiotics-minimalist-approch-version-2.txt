Second version of the idiotic minimalist approach 
=================================================

Yesterday I found out that it seems somewhat illogical to use the 

		CVVCV CVC 

pattern for nouns. It would be better to derive it from the more 
primitive <verb><pronoun> or 

			CVVCV CVC CVC

pattern. So instead of the sentence pattern of version one which was

			CVVCV CVC CVVCV CVC

there would be  used only  

			CVVCV CVC CVVCV CVC CVC

which at the first glance just looks longer but has the advantage 
that the other basic sentence structure 

			CVVCV CVC CVC

or <verb><prounoun> is incorporated in the second possible sentence 
structure. 

Thus a noun is basically a sentence of the structure <verb><pronoun>. 

It is obvious that this makes the building of much more nouns possible,
but the motivation behind this was another one - as was already mentioned. 


Word building using synonyms 
============================

Sometimes in our languages we want to describe a thing we saw, but find out 
we got no fitting word for it , so we just use two. 

" A guest or customer" , "A dog or fox " , " A colleague or friend" ,
" A bubble or ball"  ... and so on ... 

Usually that is not thought of as word building but it can be used as such. 

So in case the known techniques for word building in the language or not sufficient
this technique can be applied. 


And yet another extension to the sentence scheme
================================================

Somehow one might it think that the existing to schemes of sentences 
<verb><noun> and <verb><pronoun> are not enough and 
one or two other version would be practical sometimes. 

So the following schemes : 
			   CVVCV CVC CVC+V 
                          V+CVVCV CVC CVC
                           CVVCV CVC CVC+V

So a vowel at the end of the phrase could be used for "case marking". 

This would be practical as it could reduce the needed number of verbs 
and shorten statements which otherwise would have required two sentences 
to just one. 
		tailisannim = (the following) is or was told by the doglike animal 

adding an "u" could make the "nim" pronoun for doglike animal an object case 
so that the phrase 

		tailisannimu 

would mean  : (the following) is or was told TO the doglike animal .

adding an "i" could even effect the whole phrase in such a way that it would mean 
"it is thought of ..." or " if <statement> ..." . 
A possible sample : 

		 tailisannimi = When/If the doglike animal would say the following 
				or "It is thought the doglike animal would say the following" . 

Suppose the added "i" would mean an "if or when" statement then a "then"-clause would be expected. 
The vowel "a" could be used for this or for the idea that something is caused or made to do. 

		tailisannima = ...,then the fox would tell the following 
			       The doglike animal is or was made telling the following. 

So in other words two sentences like 
					tailisannimi tailisansika 

would be interpreted as a if-then-statement meaning something like 

			If the doglike animal tells the following , then someone will tell the following (in response). 			  	  	


And what about putting vowels in front of the statement. One practical use of that could be negation
because negation with "paulitatnis" (the following is not true) or even the abbreviated "paulisis" are 
not so short like a vowel in front. 

Possible suggestion could be : "a" in front be used for negation
			       "i" in front be used for marking that the statement is doubted, unlikely, suggested etc. 
			       "u" in front be used for making the statement a name in the vocative case

Here's a possible sample with some of the used. 

			upaaputulsan itailisannimu 

	possible translation : " Oh person who hurts or kills animals or person with a tool ! (=hunter) 
				 It is unlikely or doubted that to the doglike animal would 
				 have been told or is said the following."  	


Consequences of Version 2 
=========================

The noun word building scheme of version one seems to be more illogical and not fitting the 
noun word building scheme of version two. It must be tested or evaluated if the old verb-noun
sentence structure is compatible with the new one so that both can coexist and it would not 
be a problem to have two noun word building schemes. 

The first noun word building scheme which was basically root+idiotics(idiotic ending) really 
looked quite simple at the first glance and allowed for thousands of words to be constructed 
that way. 

The problem with the first word building scheme was something commonly called logic in that 
the nouns were not derived from verbal roots but rather a noun meaning was applied to the 
verbal roots. To be better understandable I give a sample in the old scheme and try to apply 
the new scheme on it. 

           niimalus ( niima = animal,doglike beast , +lus idiotic ending which could mean red) 

The illogical thing here is that usually in the language verbs or verb like adjectives come first
and that the first nound word building scheme in the above sample really hurts that in giving a 
construction like " doglike animal is red " or "doglike animal which is red " . 

So how would this be in the new version or version two. 
First we need a verb not yet in the corpus which would mean " ... is red " . 
I use "luusasan" here for that purpose. So using that we get 

			luusasannim ( nim = pronoun for doglike animal ) 

or practical a sentence which means "The doglike animal is red" which would have the meaning "fox" 
or "red doglike animal" in the newly introduced sentence structure. 

This seems for me to have the advantage that a sentence structure once learned used and practiced 
can be extended in use and no new thing or concept has to be learned. 

I wonder if the pronoun "lus" or "nim" would then be prefered to refer to "luusasanim".
