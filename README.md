# ConLangBase


NOTE: This is an absolute beginners project 

LICENSE: I plan to put it under the same license as projects made 
	in the Free Code Camp Community. Currently I do not know
	which license they use. 

PURPOSE: * encouraging absolute beginners, newbies etc. 
		to contribute and participate in their first github project

	* when finished or in a release state it should provide an easy
	and comfortable way to make a constructed language for human communication
	and should help to translate from one or many natural languages to the 
	constructed language 
	maybe in the future it could also provide suggestion or simplification of
	syntax , choosing the appropriate words for a specific audience or using
	the constructed language as an interlanguage to convert from one natural 
	language to another

INTRODUCTION AND REQUIREMENTS

	I have sketched the plan , grammar and so on of a very simple constructed 
	language years ago after studying the whole thing privately for more than 
	a decade. 
	However what I provide here should be only a orientation for the project as 
	a whole. Everyone here in Europe knows at least three languages - counting
	dialects and local variations of speech. So most people at least now 
	subconsciously how a language works.
	Everyone can view the source code of web pages, which contain Javascript,
	HTML-code and so on. So a web based or browser based GUI should not be a 
	problem for most people as well as contributing to the language part. 

SKETCH FOR THE START (for the beginning) 

	The project language is English - thus GUI and so on should be in English,
 	as well as documentation. Multilanguage support should not be ahead of the 
	English support. 
	Ooo ... a simple page with a text field for looking up words , adding
	words and so on would do it for the start. Later phrase search should follow. 
	It has not to be just one GUI - I even think having the choice between many and 
	even command line would be better.
